Description: a generic dynamo implementation for different key/value storage engines
 Dynomite is a thin, distributed Dynamo layer for different storage engines and
 protocols. Dynomite provides sharding and multi-data center replication. It has
 a shared nothing architecture with no single point of failure (SPOF) that 
 delivers high availability (HA) even when a server, rack or entire data center
 goes off‚Äêline.
 .
 Redis is currently the primary backend and protocol supported by Dynomite, 
 while support for Memcached is partially implemented. Future versions of 
 Dynomite will support additional backends.
